**Anonymisation**  
Altering personal data so individuals cannot be identified, directly or indirectly.

**Benefit (of data use)**  
Positive outcomes from data use (e.g., social, health, environmental).

**Data access**  
User processes data provided by a holder under set conditions without necessarily receiving a copy.

**Data controller**  
Entity deciding purposes and essential means of personal-data processing; accountable for compliance.

**Data linkage**  
Combining datasets about the same topic/person using identifiers or probabilistic methods.

**Data minimisation**  
Collect/process only what’s necessary for the stated purpose; applies across the lifecycle.

**Data permit**  
HDAB decision authorising a user to process specified health data for defined secondary-use purposes.

**Data quality**  
Fitness of health data elements for intended primary and secondary uses.

**Dataset**  
Structured collection of electronic health data.

**Dataset catalogue**  
Public, structured inventory of dataset descriptions accessible via an online portal.

**Dataset record**  
Single structured unit in a dataset (e.g., a row) describing one entity/instance.

**Dataset subset**  
Selected records/variables from a dataset preserving key characteristics.

**Dataset description**  
Metadata description of datasets published via the catalogue.

**Electronic health data**  
Personal or non-personal electronic health data.

**EU dataset catalogue**  
EU-level catalogue of dataset descriptions; EU/national/participant catalogues are public.

**Health data access application**  
Application to access personal-level data in anonymised or pseudonymised form for secondary use.

**Health Data Access Body (HDAB)**  
Member-state authority for secondary use: evaluates requests, issues permits, sources data, provides access in SPEs, and publishes permit info.

**Health data applicant**  
Person/organisation submitting a data request or access application to an HDAB for EHDS Art. 53 purposes.

**Health data holder**  
Entity with the right to process/provide health data (e.g., providers, registries, payers, research bodies, EU bodies).

**Health data request**  
Request for anonymised statistical data for permitted secondary-use purposes.

**Health data user**  
Person/organisation (incl. EU bodies) lawfully accessing data for secondary use via permit/approval.

**Intermediation entity**  
Legal person (where established) acting for certain holders to process, provide, and exchange data for secondary use.

**Interoperability**  
Ability of organisations/systems/devices to exchange and use info without changing content.

**Legal basis of data processing**  
Conditions that make processing lawful; EHDS lists secondary-use purposes.

**Metadata**  
Structured data describing content/use to aid discovery and reuse.

**National dataset catalogue**  
Public national catalogue describing sources, nature, and availability conditions of electronic health data.

**Non-personal electronic health data**  
Health data that are anonymised or never related to an identifiable person.

**Personal electronic health data**  
Health/genetic data relating to an identifiable person, processed electronically.

**Pseudonymisation**  
Processing so data can’t be attributed to a person without separately kept additional info and safeguards.

**Public value**  
Weighted view of risks/benefits: sustainability, fairness, harm assessment/mitigation, and safeguards.

**Re-identification risk**  
Likelihood that de-identified data can be linked back to a person.

**Secondary use**  
Processing health data for EHDS Chapter IV purposes other than the original purpose.

**Secure Processing Environment (SPE)**  
Controlled environment meeting security/interoperability requirements, granting access only to authorised users and logging activity.

**Trusted health data holder**  
Designated holder eligible for simplified permit procedures and able to supply data via an SPE they manage.

**Trusted third party (TTP)**  
Independent pseudonymisation entity computing pseudonyms from identifiers; holds no other data.
