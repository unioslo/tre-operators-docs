# Introduction


This documentation supports **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** operators participating in the **Federated EOSC-ENTRUST** initiative.  
It provides practical guidance for building, operating, and maintaining secure, compliant, and interoperable TREs across the federation. For definitions of key terms, see the [Glossary](appendices/glossary.md).

The goal is to:

- Enable consistent implementation of TREs aligned with EOSC-ENTRUST standards. See [TRE Fundamentals](fundamentals.md).
- Support new operators in deploying a TRE from the ground up. See [Deployment](deployment/index.md).
- Provide existing operators with reference materials for governance, compliance, and integration. See [Compliance & Certification](compliance.md), [Federation Integration](federation.md), and [Operations & Maintenance](operations.md).

## Audience

- **TRE Operators** – responsible for deployment, maintenance, and compliance. See [Glossary](appendices/glossary.md#tre-operator).
- **Infrastructure Teams** – managing compute, storage, IAM, and network security. See [Deployment](deployment/index.md).
- **Policy and Compliance Officers** – overseeing data protection, auditing, and certification. See [Compliance & Certification](compliance.md).
- **System Architects** – designing interoperable TREs within the EOSC-ENTRUST federation. See [Reference Architecture](appendices/reference-architecture.md).
