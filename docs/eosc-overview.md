# EOSC Overview

**EOSC-ENTRUST** aims to create a European network of TREs for sensitive data and drive European interoperability between them. This is achieved through the development of a **common blueprint for federated data access and analysis** â€”the **EOSC-ENTRUST Blueprint & Interoperability Framework**.

The ENTRUST Blueprint incorporates lessons and learnings from the **DARE UK Federated Architecture Blueprint**, which defines an abstract, technology-agnostic approach to interoperability based on the Five Safes framework and data space design thinking.

The broader **EOSC Federation** is conceived as a network of autonomous entities called **EOSC Nodes** that collaborate to share and manage scientific data, knowledge, and resources. An EOSC Node might be a single organisation, providing resources and services to the Federation.
