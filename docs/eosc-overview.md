# EOSC Overview

**EOSC-ENTRUST** aims to create a European network of [TREs](fundamentals.md) for sensitive data and drive European interoperability between them. This is achieved through the development of a **common blueprint for federated data access and analysis** â€”the **EOSC-ENTRUST Blueprint & Interoperability Framework**. See [Glossary](appendices/glossary.md) for definitions of key terms such as "EOSC Node" and "Five Safes".


The ENTRUST Blueprint incorporates lessons and learnings from the **DARE UK Federated Architecture Blueprint**, which defines an abstract, technology-agnostic approach to interoperability based on the [Five Safes](appendices/glossary.md#five-safes) framework and data space design thinking.


The broader **EOSC Federation** is conceived as a network of autonomous entities called **[EOSC Nodes](appendices/glossary.md#eosc-node)** that collaborate to share and manage scientific data, knowledge, and resources. An EOSC Node might be a single organisation, providing resources and services to the Federation.

For architectural details, see [Reference Architecture](appendices/reference-architecture.md). For further resources, see [Resources](appendices/resources.md).
