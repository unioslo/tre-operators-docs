# Introduction

This documentation supports **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** operators participating in the **Federated EOSC-ENTRUST** initiative.  
It provides practical guidance for building, operating, and maintaining secure, compliant, and interoperable TREs across the federation.

The goal is to:

- Enable consistent implementation of TREs aligned with EOSC-ENTRUST standards.
- Support new operators in deploying a TRE from the ground up.
- Provide existing operators with reference materials for governance, compliance, and integration.

## Audience

- **TRE Operators** – responsible for deployment, maintenance, and compliance.
- **Infrastructure Teams** – managing compute, storage, IAM, and network security.
- **Policy and Compliance Officers** – overseeing data protection, auditing, and certification.
- **System Architects** – designing interoperable TREs within the EOSC-ENTRUST federation.
