# TRE Fundamentals

 **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** is a secure digital workspace designed to provide researchers controlled access to sensitive data, typically health, social, or administrative records, while ensuring strict safeguards around privacy, security, and compliance.

## Core Characteristics
- **Data protection**: TREs prevent data from being copied or removed. Researchers access only the tools and views needed for analysis.  
- **Controlled access**: User authentication and role-based permissions ensure only approved researchers can enter.  
- **Secure compute**: Analysis is performed within a segregated, auditable environment (often virtual desktops or containers).  
- **Governed outputs**: Results are checked before leaving the environment to ensure they do not compromise data subjects.  
- **Compliance**: TREs align with legal and ethical frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, or national research governance.  

## Why TREs Matter
TREs balance the **need for research access** with the **obligation to protect sensitive data**. They enable reproducible, large-scale studies while ensuring that privacy and trust are maintained.
