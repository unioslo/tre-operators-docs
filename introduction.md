Within DARE UK, a **Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** is defined as a highly secure digital infrastructure designed to enable approved researchers to access, manage, and analyse sensitive data in a controlled and privacy-preserving manner.

TREs ensure that data remain within the safeguarded environment at all times — researchers view and process de-identified or anonymised datasets remotely, but cannot extract raw data. Only approved analytical outputs may leave the environment after disclosure control.

Access to a TRE is governed by the **Five Safes framework** — *safe people, safe projects, safe settings, safe data, and safe outputs* — ensuring that both data security and public trust are upheld.

DARE UK positions TREs as the foundation of a federated national infrastructure for sensitive data research, promoting consistency, interoperability, and trust.
